This document outlines all legal requirements and operational standards expected of CSPs within the marketplace.

- **Submitting the Signed Contract**:

#### Receiving and Accepting the Credential Offer
- **Credential Offer**:

#### Finalizing the Credential
- **Credential in Unsigned State**:
    - Once the PIN is entered, the credential will appear in your wallet in an 'unsigned' state, which means it is not yet validated or signed.
      
      ![Screenshot of the unsigned credential](./assets/wallet-7.png)

- **Manual Validation and Signing**:
    - The credential requires manual intervention for validation and signing. This process typically takes between 2-4 business days. You will be notified by email once your credential is signed and ready to be downloaded.
